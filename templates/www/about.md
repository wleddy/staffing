# About the SABA Volunteer Signup Web Site

This web site is based on an open source project designed to help non-profit organizations to manage
their Volunteer and Staff shift signup process.

The source for the project is available to anyone interested at [github.com/wleddy/staffing/](http://github.com/wleddy/staffing/).

More information about the system is available [in the docs](/docs/)
