#Tasks

A Task record describes what is needed to fulfill part of an Activity. A Task has the following attributes:

* A date
* Start and end times
* The skills required of staff or volunteer to perform the task
* The number of people requested for the task at the given skill level

A person signs up for a "Position" in the Task. There may be multiple Positions for a Task. 

For example if you want 2 volunteers for a Task that runs from 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock you would set 
the "Number of People Requested" to 2 for that task. 

If you want more volunteers for a 6 to 8 time period, you need to create a new Task for those Positions.

Likewise, if you need a "Valet Lead" person to oversee a "Bike Valet" Activity, you will need to create
another Task and assign an appropriate Skill level to the Task.

## Create / Edit Tasks
 1. From Activity record select a Task or create new
 2. Provide Title
 3. Provide Description of task.
    The description may use [*Markdown*](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) syntax to create a rich
    presentation when viewed by visitors.
 4. Provide Date (one day only per task)
 5. Provide Start and End times
 6. Specify skills (user roles) required for the Task. At least one skill level is required.
 7. Specify maximum number of people requested.

> Repeat for all Tasks for this Activity

###Skills

The list of skills available for Tasks is based on the the User Roles records. The site administrator will
need to create Roles that represent the jobs that you need done.
