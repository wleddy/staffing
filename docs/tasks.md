#Tasks

A Task record describes what is needed to fulfill part of an activity. A Task has the following attributes:

* A date for the task
* Start and end times for the task
* The skills required of staff or volunteer
* The number of people requested for the task at this skill level

A person is signed up for a "Slot". There may be more than on Slot for a Task. For example if you want
2 volunteers for the 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock Task you will create 2 Slots for that task. 

If you want more volunteers for a 6 to 8 time period, 
you need to create a new Task with those Slots.

Likewise, if you need a "Valet Lead" person to oversee an "Bike Valet" Activity, you will need to create
as Task for that and assign an appropriate Skill level to the Task.
