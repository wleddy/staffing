# Activities

The central element of the system are the Activities. Activities don't have a date as part of their
data domain. In our experience activities tend to repeat on a yearly or other basis. The dates and times of an Activity 
are defined by [Tasks](/docs/tasks.md).

An Activity must occur in only one Location.
