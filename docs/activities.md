# Activities

All Events are organized within "Activities". The Activity record should be thought of as the goal to be accomplished
during one or more "Events" that are organized under that activity.

For example, and Activity like "Bake Sale" might take place several times during the year, and over the course of a few
years as well. Each "Event" associated with the Activity happens on a specific date. The Activity record provides a way to 
keep the Bake Sale events organized.
