#Tasks

A Task is a record of what is required to fulfill a task that is part of an activity. A Task associated with an Activity
has the following attributes:

* A date for the task
* Start and end times for the task
* The skills required of staff or volunteer
* The number of people requested for the task at this skill level

Each person is signing up for a "Slot". There may be more than on Slot for a Task. For example if you want
4 volunteers for the 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock Task. If you want more volunteers for the 6 to 8 time period, 
you need to create a new Task with those Slots.
