# Events

The central element of the system are the Events. Events don't have a date as part of their
data domain. In our experience events tend to repeat on a yearly or other basis. The dates and times of an Event 
are defined by [Jobs](/docs/jobs.md).

An Event may specify a Location though it is not required.

## Create / Edit Event
1. login
1. Select Event or make new
1. Provide a Title for the Event.
1. Provide a detailed description of the event. 
    The description may use [*Markdown*](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) syntax to create a rich
    presentation when viewed by visitors.
1. Specify Location from Location list if desired.
1. Update general event description
