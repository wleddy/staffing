# Attendance and Thank Yous

In order to verify attendance (particularly of staff) a followup email or text will be sent to all participants
the day after the Activity. In their response participants will be able to confirm their attendance and report 
any issues or concerns.

### Staff Response
Staff will be asked to provide the hours they worked for each task. They may also report any issues or
comments about the shift.

### Volunteer Response
The volunteer response is primarily a Thank You and a chance for them to report any issues or comments.

> Responses to emails and texts will update the attendance records automatically.
