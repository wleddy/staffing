# Attendance and Thank Yous

In order to verify attendance (particularly of staff) a followup email and / or text will be sent to all participants
the day after the Activity. In their response participants will be able to confirm their attendance and report 
any issues or concerns.

### Staff Response
Staff will be asked to provide the following:
* The hours they worked
* Reimbursable mileage
* They may also report any issues or comments about the shift such as equipment or supplies.

### Volunteer Response
The volunteer response is primarily a Thank You and a chance for them to report any issues or comments.

> Responses to emails and texts will update the attendance records automatically.
