# Staff and Volunteer Signup

## Discovering Available Positions

We will provide a url that staff and members of the public can view to see work and volunteer opportunities.

When viewing the list of positions, the content will vary depending on the visitors "skills" as specified in 
their user record. Visitor who are not yet signed in will only see basic volunteer listings. 

Staff and volunteers with particular qualifications will need to login to see additional opportunities.

**About Volunteer Accounts:** Unlike "normal" users a person who only intends to volunteer will not be
required to provide a user name or password. An email address and name are required as that is their only 
sign in credential. A phone number will be requested but is optional.
