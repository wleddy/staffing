How to manage Event records
=====================================

An Event record is used to organize a set of Jobs that are to be done on a specific date.

Events are associated with an Activity, so, for example, you have an Activity called *Bake Sale* that happens a few times a year. From the Bake Sale activity record
you would create a new Event record, then create a few Job records to represent the things you will need people to do during the event.

The Event record is also used to manage the information that will be displayed on the calendar. 

.. note:: You must have manager access for Events to access the Event records.

How to Create or Edit an Event
----------------------------------------------
#. Open an existing Activity record.
    Choose **Staff Admin -> Activities** from the main menu, then click on an Activity record in the listing.
#. Select Event or make a new one.
    Click the **New Event** button or click the **Edit** button of the event you want to update.
#. Specify the status of the Event.
     If the event is ready to go, set the status to "Scheduled" and it will appear on the calendar and staff and volunteers will be able to sign up for jobs.
     
     On the other hand, you may set the status to "Pending" or "Cancelled" to keep it private.
     
   .. warning:: Marking an event as Cancelled will ***NOT*** cause a notification to be sent to staff or volunteers who have signed up for the event. You will need to do that by cancelling their assignment in the job records.
     
#. Provide a detailed description of the event.
   The description may use `Markdown <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax>`_ syntax to create a rich presentation when viewed by visitors. (Or you can just type something.)
#. Specify Location from Location list if desired.
    If an event is to happen at (mostly) a single location, then select the location from the drop down list and all the Jobs that are part of the event will be able to use that location by default.

    If, on the other hand, some or all of the Jobs are to be carried out at various locationsyou will be able to specify the location of each job individually (or just use the event location as the default)
#. Update the Calendar information:
    At a minimum you will need to set:

    * The *Event Times* 
       The date and time of the start and end of the public part of the event.
    * The *Service Times*
       The date and time of the start and end of the service you will be providing. 

#. Choose the Event Manager.
    Select the name of a manager from the drop down list. The manager's contact information will appear in the event Roster and will be the primary point of contact for staff and volunteers for this event.
#. Specify Client contact info if needed.
     You can either select a client from the drop down list, or enter the infromation directly.


Something Else?
-----------------------------
Now that you have created an event, you will need to create some `Job records <jobs.html>`_ so people can actually sign up.
